# File Navigator Privacy Policy

File Navigator is an open source Android app developed by me, Janek Zangenberg, alias w2sv (W2SV).
The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/w2sv/FileNavigator) under
the [GPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/w2sv/FileNavigator/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

File Navigator does not collect, let alone share, data of whichever kind.
In-app configurations made by you are stored locally on your device, and will thus
remain entirely private.

File Navigator requires access to manage all files to register new navigatable files,
corresponding to the
properties which you may configure within the application, entering the file system, and to move
them upon you
explicitly selecting one
of the move options presented in the notifications you will receive. It is important to note that
this permission is __exclusively__ utilized for these specific purposes and is not employed for any
other functionality, let alone data collection.

Should you have any doubts or general inquiries regarding the above stated privacy policy, feel free
to reach out to me @ zangenbergjanek@googlemail.com.

Sincerely,\
